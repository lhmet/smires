Most IRES metrics are constructed in a similar way.

1. Derive a binary time series from (daily) discharge observations.
2. Aggregate on an annual basis.
3. Aggreate every year to obtain a single metric per `state`.

This steps are explained in detail for the mean annual number of no-flow days. First of all we need to load the R-package **smires**, assuming it is already installed on your machine.


```{r, message=FALSE}
library(smires)
```

This page was generated with `r R.version.string` and **smires** version `r packageVersion("smires")`.

Suppose we have an spreadsheet like the following named `goryczkowy.xlsx` with two columns. The first column contains the date (preferably in the following format 'year-month-day', which is Rs default `format = '%Y-%m-%d'`) and the second column contains the discharges. 

![spreadsheet](../inst/demos/goryczkowy.png)

It is best to save the spreadsheet in text format, eihter as txt or csv (comma separated values). Depending on your language settings, the resulting file (`goryczkowy.csv`) might look like the following. Here the semicolon `';'` is used as a field separator and the comma `','` is the decimal separator. 


```{r, echo=FALSE, comment=""}
filename <- "../ts/pl/goryczkowy.csv"
cat(readLines(filename, n = 10), sep = "\n")
```

This file can be imported into R with the following command

```{r}
filename <- "../ts/pl/goryczkowy.csv"
read.csv2(filename, colClasses = c("Date", "numeric")) %>%
    validate(approx.missing = 0)
```
