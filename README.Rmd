SMIRES is a COST Action addressing the Science and Management of Intermittent Rivers & Ephemeral Streams. SMIRES brings together more than 200 hydrologists, biogeochemists, ecologists, modelers, environmental economists, social researchers and stakeholders from 31 different countries to develop a research network for synthesising the fragmented, recent knowledge on IRES, improving our understanding of IRES and translating this into a science-based, sustainable management of river networks. More information about SMIRES can be found at <http://www.smires.eu/>. 

This git repository hosts the R-package `smires`, one of several outcomes of Working Group 1 (WG1, Prevalence, distribution and trends of IRES). Given time series of daily (weekly, monthly) discharges, its purpose is:


* to identify gauging stations that have an IRES flow regime;
* to calculate relevant flow and intermittency metrics.

# Installation of the R-package

In order to use the development version of the package `smires`  you will need to install the package `devtools` once. 

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
```


It provides the convenient command `install_github()` which installs the most recent version of a package hosted on github. To do so, simply execute the following three lines:
``` r
library(devtools)
install_github("mundl/smires")
library(smires)
```

The current version is ``r packageVersion("smires")``. To load this package in an R session, `library(smires)` has to be called. 
``` r
library(smires)
packageVersion("smires")
```

# Vignettes

The usage of the package is demonstrated in these four preliminary vignettes. They are currently under development.
 
 * The [concept](https://homepage.boku.ac.at/h0540352/smires/concept.html) of the R package **smires**.
 * How to compute smires [metrics](https://homepage.boku.ac.at/h0540352/smires/metrics.html).
 * To compute the metrics mentioned above, we make use of the following [framework](https://homepage.boku.ac.at/h0540352/smires/framework.html).
 * This [vignette](https://homepage.boku.ac.at/h0540352/import/metrics.html) explains in detail how data and meta data is imported. 


# Examples

Each participating country was asked to suggest metrics and to submit a few time series with intermittent streamflow. As we plan to integrate the provided time series in the R package, we need permission of the copyright holder to make the data available. The column **include** of the following table indicates if the data can be published. 


### Time Series

Currently ``r length(unique(dat$country))`` countries have submitted time series of which  ``r length(unique(dat$country[dat$include]))`` countries agreed on including the data into the R-package.

poly$col[poly$country %in% dat$country[dat$include]] <- "available & included"

library(ggplot2)
p <- ggplot(poly, aes(long, lat, group = id, fill = col)) +
